# room-escape-using-unity

This is a Room Escape game with procedural generation using Unity. The first person controller will attach [RoomGenerator.cs](https://github.com/dickylai/room-escape-using-unity/blob/master/Scripts/RoomGenerator.cs) and [ControlInterface.cs](https://github.com/dickylai/room-escape-using-unity/blob/master/Scripts/ControlInterface.cs) in order to provide generation during runtime.
